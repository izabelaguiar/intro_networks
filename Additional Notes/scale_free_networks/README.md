# The Scale-Free Network Divide

On Thursday we went over power law distributions and their prevalence in settings where "popularity" is measured. I later was talking with [Phil Chodrow](https://www.philchodrow.com)
about what we covered in class (Phil is a wonderful professor in the CS department who does super-awesome research on networks) and he said "oh but _are_ there power laws?
What side do you fall on in _The Great Divide_?" 

Turns out, the "drama" surrounding this work that I referred to in class on Thursday is much more fleshed out than I alluded to, 
and has some implications that are very important to our class!

I'm uploading some relevant resources in this folder, in case you want to learn more about _The Great Divide_. 

The tl;dr is that, in 2005, [Aaron Clauset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Clauset) questioned the ubiquity of scale-free networks in an online
blogpost. This blogpost, accompanied by a later-published 2009 paper "Power-Law Distributions in Empirical Data", started the divide. 
In 2018, Clauset and Anna Broido published the paper _Scale-Free Networks Are Rare_ (networks exhibiting power law distributions in 
their degree sequence are sometimes referred to as being "scale-free"), in which they develop a rigorous statistical test for determining if a network's
degree sequence follows a power law distribution. They find that only 4\% of the ~1000 networks they test exhibit "the strongest-possible evidence of scale-free
structure." 

The excellent [Atlantic Article]((https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/power-laws-networks/553562/)) covering the Divide quotes Clauset,
> Clauset sees his work with Broido not as an attack but as a call to action to network scientists, to examine a more diverse set of possible mechanisms and degree distributions than they have been doing. “Perhaps we should consider new ideas, as opposed to trying to force old ideas to fit,” he says.
