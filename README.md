# Introduction to Networks: Middlebury College MATH1010
This is the course webpage for MATH1010, taught January 2023 at Middlebury College. We meet in Warner Hall 104 on Mondays and Thursdays from 1-4pm and on Tuesdays from 1-3pm.

The course textbook is _Networks, Crowds, and Markets_, by Easley and Kleinberg. It can be accessed for free [through this link](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/). Most readings and lecture notes will come from this textbook, and any additional readings will be uploaded here as a pdf

The course syllabus, including a (tentative) schedule with corresponding readings, is accessible here as the file `MATH1010_Syllabus.pdf`. 

Weekly homework assignments will be uploaded here on Tuesday mornings, and will be due at the beginning of class on Tuesdays. If you like to typeset your solutions in LaTeX you may email me your solutions as a pdf to `iaguiar@middlebury.edu`. Otherwise, you may bring a (legible) handwritten copy to turn in before class starts.

Any announcements will be posted below and emailed to you.

## Annoucements 
### January 30 | Course Reviews
In addition to filling out your Middlebury course review, [please fill out the anonymous course review here](https://forms.gle/w4BtSVkMBmfeEiuk8). I intend to teach this class again in the future (and I hope to keep teaching in general!) and your feedback is deeply appreciated.

### January 25 | Wisdom and/or Madness of Crowds by Nicky Case
In class tomorrow we'll be learning about information cascades and diffusion through a network. The _best_ way (in my opinion) to think about these concepts is through Nicky Case's [Wisdom and/or Madness of Crowds simulation](https://ncase.me/crowds/). So, we'll spend a bit of time in class playing with their website!

### January 19 | Power Law Distributions | The Great Divide
Turns out I had NO IDEA the can of worms I squeaked open when I referenced "some sort of drama with power laws and Barabasi" in class yesterday.

I'll talk about this in class on Monday, but for those of you who are curious, I've dumped a bunch of resources/links/papers on what I've since learned is referred to as The Great Divide in the [scale_free_networks](https://github.com/izabelaguiar/midd_networks/tree/main/Additional%20Notes/scale_free_networks) folder on our GitHub.

### January 18 | TODO: Survey for project teams
Please have one member of your project team [fill out this survey by Monday](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5sA3A_CGKfzZFeSqg6wH8DMITAtQ4y503lWORjQ1awQR2uw/viewform?usp=sf_link). If you do not have a project team yet, please fill this survey out too, as I will use it to pair you with others who don't have a team. If you have two people in your team, you might have another added. 

### January 16 | HW2 Uploaded
I just uploaded HW2 which will be due January 24.

### January 16 | Three reminders
I hope you all had a lovely long weekend. I wanted to remind you that I'll be having make-up office hours tomorrow from 10-12. I also wanted to remind you that HW1 is due tomorrow by 1pm. You may email it to me or bring in a paper copy to turn in at the beginning of class. I won't accept any late work tomorrow, so please turn it in on time.

Final reminder is to please bring your laptops tomorrow for our computer lab together.

### January 13 | Agenda Updated and Notes Uploaded
I've updated the Agenda and Syllabus to reflect the sections of the textbook we covered this week. I've also uploaded two additional notes files, `Adj_mats.pdf` and `Centrality_measures.pdf`. I incorrectly wrote down the definition of closeness centrality for connected graphs yesterday: it's been corrected in this pdf. The definition for disconnected graphs, although unintuitive, was correct (phew!). Have a lovely long weekend and I'll see you all Tuesday.
### January 10 | HW 1 Uploaded
Homework 1 is uploaded to the GitHub Homework folder. It is due January 17.

### January 9 | Asynchronous Activities Uploaded
As a reminder, we're not meeting in person tomorrow. Instead, I've uploaded some asynchronous activities to our GitHub page that you'll need to complete by Thursday.

You'll see two files in the Computer_Lab​ folder of the GitHub. Please open the Jan10_TODO.md​ file first and complete the tasks that are outlined in the file (including the online quiz which must be done by 11:59pm Tues 1/10).

For those of you who would like to walk through the activities in the Jan10_TODO.md​ file together, or if you run into any issues, I'll be in our regular classroom from 3-4pm.

HW0 is due by 1pm tomorrow, although if you have a hard copy you can bring it to me at 3pm or slide it under my office door before then. I'll upload HW1 tomorrow morning and email you all.

### January 7 | Additional Notes Uploaded
I've uploaded the additional notes from Thursday that aren't covered in the book: definitions of degree, in/out-degree, and different types of graphs. I've also updated the Syllabus and Agenda with the specific sections of Chapter 2 that we've covered.
I've also edited the schedule for Tuesday 1/10 because I did a PST->EST time conversion wrong. For those who would like to work through the Tuesday activities in person, I'll hold additional office hours in our classroom from 3-4pm. This change is also in the syllabus.

### January 4 | Syllabus Correction
I learned last night that we do not have class on **Monday, January 16** in observation of MLK Jr. Day. I have updated the agenda in the syllabus to reflect this.

### January 3 | Welcome to MATH1010
I hope you all had a lovely break and are settling back into campus nicely.

Our first day of class will be *Thursday, January 5 from 1-4pm* in Warner Hall 104. If you haven't already, *please let me know if you're unable to attend*. The first day will be part syllabus, part introductions, part (hopefully fun) activity, and part starting the material.

You should all have access to the canvas page for this course (please let me know if you do not), but we'll primarily be using this GitHub repository for our course website. We'll go through everything in class on Thursday but I wanted to give you the opportunity to snoop around beforehand.

Finally, for the first week (maybe more) I'll be masking in class. You all are welcome to do whatever feels most comfortable for you, but please keep in mind that we will need to move things online if too many people in our class get sick.

Looking forward to meeting you all.
