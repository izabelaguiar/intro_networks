# Introduction to Networks: Middlebury College MATH1010
This is the course webpage for MATH1010, taught January 2023 at Middlebury College. We meet in Warner Hall 104 on Mondays and Thursdays from 1-4pm and on Tuesdays from 1-3pm.

The course textbook is _Networks, Crowds, and Markets_, by Easley and Kleinberg. It can be accessed for free [through this link](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/). Most readings and lecture notes will come from this textbook, and any additional readings will be uploaded here as a pdf

The course syllabus, including a (tentative) schedule with corresponding readings, is accessible here as the file `MATH1010_Syllabus.pdf`. 

Weekly homework assignments will be uploaded here on Tuesday mornings, and will be due at the beginning of class on Tuesdays. If you like to typeset your solutions in LaTeX you may email me your solutions as a pdf to `iaguiar@middlebury.edu`. Otherwise, a handwritten copy may be turned in before class starts.

Any announcements will be posted below and emailed to you.

## Annoucements 
### January 3 | Welcome to MATH1010
I hope you all had a lovely break and are settling back into campus nicely.

Our first day of class will be *Thursday, January 5 from 1-4pm* in Warner Hall 104. If you haven't already, *please let me know if you're unable to attend*. The first day will be part syllabus, part introductions, part (hopefully fun) activity, and part starting the material.

You should all have access to the canvas page for this course (please let me know if you do not), but we'll primarily be using this GitHub repository for our course website. We'll go through everything in class on Thursday but I wanted to give you the opportunity to snoop around beforehand.

Finally, for the first week (maybe more) I'll be masking in class. You all are welcome to do whatever feels most comfortable for you, but please keep in mind that we will need to move things online if too many people in our class get sick.

Looking forward to meeting you all.
