    "## Last week's CL\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub\n",
    "We'll use GitHub-light: as a place to upload completed CL assignments, a place to collaborate with your group members, and as a general introduction to a service that is used a ton. \n",
    "Let's explore GitHub together. Ask any questions that come up as we do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The command line\n",
    "The command line is used to navigate/control your computer without clicking around. It's helpful in so many cases. One of the best parts about the command line (in my opinion) is that if you're ever unsure of how to do something/fix something/check something out on your computer, you can google \"how to __ command line\". You can change weird computer settings there, you can find and save old text messages from there, etc., etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `pip`\n",
    "`pip` is a package manager that we use through the command line. It helps us install python packages easily by just typing `pip install package_name` into our command line. It checks that we have the correct dependencies and versions of everything needed to use the package, and it installs everything for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "I use jupyter notebooks for almost everything. If I have to write a big chunk of code to run on a remote server, but I want to debug it and play with it first, I do it here. If I want to take notes on a paper I'm reading, I do it here. I even write all my todo lists and my daily agendas in jupyter noteboks. And, obviously, I use them to teach!\n",
    "\n",
    "I've found that when I have to write a lot of code, it feels intimidating for me to do it in a blank text file or in some IDE (integrated development environment: usually a desktop app that helps with creating, writing, formatting, and executing code). Jupyter notebooks feel so much more approachable to me-- it's easier to comment code, because you can type in markdown cells. It's easier to run tiny bits of code without having to make different files. It's nice to immediately see visualizations and be able to tweak them easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "Python is a coding language that you can learn more about [in any of these tutorials](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers). We won't be covering the philosophy or nitty-gritty details of python or of coding in general. Our focus is going to be on **building a specific toolset that we can use in practice**. While the gist of this specific toolset can be used generally, we'll be focusing on tools that will help us analyse networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an introductory class with no prerequisites, there's a wide range of familiarity with coding and with coding in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"python_familiarity.png\" width = 900>\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm hoping that today's exercise has something in it for everybody! If you're new to python, please tell me if you're overwhelmed. If this is old hat, please read the optional challenge questions."
