# README
This folder has everything you'll need for our Computer Lab exercise today.


Navigate to [this GitHub page](https://download-directory.github.io/) and paste [this link](https://github.com/izabelaguiar/midd_networks/tree/main/Computer_Lab/Jan_24)

This page will zip the files in the `Jan_24` folder and save them to your downloads. Then, save all the files to your local folder where you're storing your MATH1010 work.
