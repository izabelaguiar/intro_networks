If there is an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ in the network, then the `[i,j]` entry of the adjacency matrix is equal to 1. In an _undirected_ network, if there is an edge between $i$ and $j$, then not only will `A[i,j]= 1`, but `A[j, i]=1` as well. This means that for one edge, the adjacency matrix has _two_ `1` values.

    "# Challenges:\n",
    "- Look up the `networkx` documentation for the `sigma` function. \n",
    "    * How could we meaningfully use this function to inform us about _how_ a graph is connected?\n",
    "    * Does this have any implications for disease spread? How about happiness? \n",
    "- Look up the `networkx` documentation for the `minimum_edge_cut` function. \n",
    "    * Use this function to find a different graph partitioning. Compare the results to those of Girvan-Newman\n",
    "- Look up the `networkx` documentation for the `girvan_newman` function. \n",
    "    * Find `k=3` communities in the Karate network\n",
    "- Look up the `graph_edit_distance` documentation.\n",
    "    * Use this to think up a way to test for homophily in a network\n",
    "        * Possible hint: you could use an Erdos Renyi graph or another random graph to compare.\n",
    "        * _DISCLAIMER: I just came up with this question on-the-fly; I have no idea if there's a \"good answer\"_"
