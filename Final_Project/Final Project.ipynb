    "# Final Project\n",
    "The goal of the final project is to practice what we've learned in the class, on a real network dataset. You'll need to combine the intuition and framework of what we've learned during lectures with the toolset we've covered during computer labs. Plus, you'll be asked to creatively think about your dataset outside the scope of the tools you have. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your final project will be done in groups of 2-3 people (no exceptions for larger or smaller groups). Your presentation and writeup will be graded on the inclusion of the items in the following description. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Project Guidelines\n",
    "For your final project, your team will be asked to complete the following tasks\n",
    "* Decide what network you'd like to study. There are options and ideas below.\n",
    "* Learn about the network dataset you've been assigned. Describe it for us. \n",
    "    * what are the nodes?\n",
    "        * How many nodes are there?\n",
    "    * what are the edges?\n",
    "        * How many edges are there?\n",
    "    * Is it weighted or unweighted?\n",
    "        * If weighted, what do the weights represent/mean?\n",
    "    * directed or undirected?\n",
    "    * is it connected or disconnected? if disconnected, is there a giant component?\n",
    "    * Is there anything interesting or weird about it?\n",
    "    * What's the context of this network?\n",
    "    * Do you have access to any metadata about the nodes?\n",
    "* Create an adjacency matrix for your matrix using your `.csv` file\n",
    "* Plot your network\n",
    "* Find the most central node(s) in your network \n",
    "    * Do so for each of the four centrality metrics we've discussed in class. \n",
    "        * Plot your network with a different colour for each \"most central\" node\n",
    "    * Do the centrality metrics identify different node(s) as the \"most central\"? \n",
    "    * Given the context of your dataset, interpret which centrality metric _you_ think is most informative. Explain.\n",
    "* Find and plot the communities in your network\n",
    "    * We've only discussed one graph partitioning algorithm to do this: Girvan-Newman. \n",
    "    * Do the identified communities make sense given the context of your data?\n",
    "* Report on and interpret one more attribute of the data. Examples are:\n",
    "    * Average (in/out-)degree\n",
    "    * Average clustering coefficient\n",
    "    * Degree distribution \n",
    "    * Average shortest path\n",
    "    * [Anything documented here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/index.html)\n",
    "        * NOTE: If you report on an attribute of the data that we have _not_ covered in class, you are expected to _understand it_ well enough to describe it to the class. You are welcome to come to my office hours to discuss this, or to make an appointment with me. Most of the `networkx` documentation includes a description of the method/metric/algorithm\n",
    "* Conclude\n",
    "    * Do you think about this dataset differently than you did before? \n",
    "    * Did you learn anything about the discipline/domain the network lies in?\n",
    "    * What's something you wish you could learn about the network that you might not have a tool for?\n",
    "    * Is there any metadata about the nodes/edges that you wish you could have to interpret your findings better?"
